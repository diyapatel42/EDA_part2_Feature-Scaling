# Exploratory Data Analysis: Feature Scaling

This notebook is part of the data preprocessing phase, focusing on feature scaling in the dataset. The notebook includes a variety of strategies for scaling features, each applicable depending on the nature of the data and the desired outcome of the analysis.

## Description

Feature scaling is crucial in data analysis and machine learning model performance. The choice of scaling method can influence the insights derived from the data and the effectiveness of predictive models. This notebook outlines several methods for feature scaling, each demonstrated with a practical example.

## Methods Implemented

### Deleting Columns with Unscalable Data:
Columns that cannot be scaled meaningfully are removed from the dataset. This method is direct but may result in the loss of potentially important data for the analysis.

### Min-Max Normalization:
Rescales the feature to a specific range, typically [0, 1]. This method is useful for algorithms that are sensitive to the magnitude of values.

### Standardization (Z-score normalization):
Transforms the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This method is beneficial for models that assume the data is normally distributed.

### Robust Scaling:
Uses the interquartile range to scale features, thus mitigating the influence of outliers. Suitable for datasets with outliers.

### Feature Scaling for Ordinal Data:
Applies scaling techniques that consider the order of values, preserving the relative positioning of values in features.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook:

1. Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. The data file should be in the same directory as the notebook, or update the path to the file within the notebook.
3. The required Python libraries include pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Install them using pip if not already available.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

Replace the 'data.csv' in the notebook with the actual path to your dataset. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to observe the different methods of feature scaling.
